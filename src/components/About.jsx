          I have completed my MERN stack development course and am currently
          pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Hons) through
          IGNOU. I enjoy drawing and exploring different artistic styles, which
          allows me to express my creativity. I am eager to apply my technical
          skills in web development as I advance in my career.
